We offer a open source blockchain solution, in which CITA as the blockchain kernel, and around CITA, we offer a whole set of open source toolchain to make infrastructure friendly for operators, developers and end users, including Dapp wallet Cyton, blockchain browser microscope, block cache server Rebirth, multi-platform SDK, etc.

## CITA | Blockchain Kernel

CITA is a high performance kernel developed by Cryptape, commissioned by Nervos Foundation. CITA could be used to build a consortium permissioned blockchain or a public permissioned blockchain.

### Cyton | DApp Wallet

Cyton provides a real-world portal for users to access the blockchain world. Cyton，on the one hand， helps users manager their private key，various types of digital assets, private property rights and private data. More importantly, as a DAPP operating platform, it can support to run Dapp inside of it.

Imagining a blockchain game developer who only needs to complete the core development of smart contracts and website of Dapp, complex private key management and digital asset management business are taken over by open source Cyton. Users only need to enter the DApp URL or even sweep the code to access DAPP and complete the game operation. Developers can also use payment services to integrate into the action page, such as using WeChat recharge to purchase game props on the blockchain. Third-party developers can also create new DApp (game replicas, etc.) to interact with the original DApp at the smart contract level, to achieve decentralized collaboration, and work together for the value of users.

Cyton operators or DAPP developers can also choose to refactor Cyton code to provide users with more professional and targeted services. It is believed that this will greatly reduce the developer's threshold, but also reduce the user's learning difficulties.

### Microscope | Blockchain Browser

Microscope is a full-featured blockchain browser platform. With Microscope you can access data of blocks, transactions, account (including contracts) on any specified chains build by CITA, as well as call contract methods and view chain's real-time performance index. A cache server is also provided for caching blockchain data. It can be easily deployed to cache data from any specified chains for application usage.

未来 Microscope 将增加数字资产访问、结构化数据展示等功能。对应地，我们将提供一个链上 KV 数据自动转换为本地关系型数据的中间件，以方便 DApp 的开发。开发者可以通过中间件快速索引业务数据，为用户提供更加友好的服务。

### Rebirth | Blockchain Data Cache Server

Rebirth is a server-side component that provides blockchain data caching services. It provides the data caching and query services required for microscope and Cyton, which can speed up the query service, and enhance the software usage experience.

### Multi-platform SDK | Software Development Kit

Blockchain operations are difficult for the vast majority of developers, given complex operations such as signature, message assembly, and ABI calls. To this end, we provide a multi-platform SDK to further reduce the development threshold. The open source SDK, which is currently being maintained, includes JavaScript, Java, Ruby, and Swift. Users can also use the web3 SDK of the Ethereum at the same time, enabling the same DApp front end to support both the Ethereum network and the CITA network.

### CITA Truffle Box | DApp Development Framework

This truffle box is customized for you to work with CITA. You can use this box to develop DApps on CITA.
